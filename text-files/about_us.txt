Our History

Although the location has been a Thai restaurant for more than two decades, the current Thai 
family has own the establishment since August 2007.

Our dishes are classic Thai favorites, influenced by the family's Southern Thai roots.

You will always find family members working in the kitchen to proudly provide you with a piece of their culture.
